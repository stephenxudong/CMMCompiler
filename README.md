This is my work in **Interpreter Construction** Class: construct a Interpreter for C--(a true subset of C)
First **Lexical** Analysis
Then **Syntax** Analysis
Finally I choose to Interprete and run **without generating Intermediate code**
IN Syntax Analysis, I use **Recursive descent analysis** similar to LL(1)
Maybe I will try LR(1) in future to rewrite  robust code.
